===============================================================================================
ngx_log_if_module is an independent module which allows you to control when not to write down
access log, similar to the "CustomLog [env=XXX]" directive in Apache.

===Directive===================================================================================
Syntax:  access_log_bypass_if (condition)
Default: -
Scope:   main/srv/loc

"access_log_bypass_if" defines the condition that nginx will not write down access log in case
it is true. The condition is enclosed by brackets... In brief, the syntax of condition in
"access_log_bypass_if" is the same as it in the "if" directive.

This directive allows you to define multiple conditions in the form of using the directive in
multiple times in the same block. For example:

<pre>
server {
    access_log_bypass_if ($status = 400);
    access_log_bypass_if ($host ~* 'nolog.com');
}
</pre>

However, if you define them both in the blocks in the father child relationship, the child block
will not inherit and merge the configuration in parent block, of course. FOr example:

<pre>
server {
    access_log_bypass_if ($status = 400);

    location / {
        access_log_bypass_if ($host ~* 'nolog.com');
    }
}
</pre>

In this case above, in location "/", only "($host ~* 'nolog.com')" is available, but "($status = 400)"
is ignored and makes no difference.
